    <h1>My Story.</h1>
      <a>
        <p>I was born and left to age in wine for thirty years. Nooo but sometimes I wish that 🤣. But first things first.
        </p>
      <p>Everything started in Quito back in 1992. It was May the 29th when my mom dropped me to the world. I joined a family consisting of mom, dad and two brothers. From the very beginning my brothers Fernando (aka Nando) and Francisco (aka Gordo) tried to raise me like a boy. Maybe that’s the reason why I like Mortal Kombat more than barbies 😂 . After all these years of innocence I came to High School. I made new friends, grew (mentally not body wise 🤣) and luckily learned English, which I would benefit from years later if you know what I mean 😉. But one of the best things was still the fresh orange juice which my mom prepared for me for breakfast every day 😊.
      </p>
      <p>Then the big party started, I enrolled in a university. I was working, studying and partying. So as you can imagine there was not much time for sleep and it was not needed (I wish I could still say this 🤣 ). Besides that I also became a dog mom. First Bianca joined our family and later also Juana.
      </p>
      <p>After my successful graduation I continued working with Nestlé and partying, of course! I had a great time there with various projects, amazing colleagues and a lot of memories. But as everything in life this chapter came to an end as little Monica decided to go to Germany.
      </p>
      <p>It was time for growing personally and professionally in a new environment. My brother Nando and Ali who already lived for several years in Germany and their little princess Mia supported me a lot for an almost flawless start in the new chapter of my life. However against the coldness they also couldn’t do anything 😂. But then I met Andy and the coldness was gone 😊.</p>
      <p>From now on things went really fast I enrolled in a master program, made my first internship in germany, graduated and finally started my professonial career in a space company. I have never thought that would happen 😁. On top of that my family got an addition, prince Leon.
      </p>
      <p>And now as we are here in Italy together it seems that I can’t avoid starting the next chapter – my thirties! I am sooo happy that each of you is here to celebrate with me! Let’s have a great weekend!
